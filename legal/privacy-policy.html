    <h2>
        Information Collection and Use
    </h2>
    <p>
        We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you register on the
        Services, express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and
        Services, when you participate in activities on the Services, or otherwise when you contact
        us.
        We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services, communicate
        with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also process
        your information for other purposes with your consent. We process your information only when
        we have a valid legal reason to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
        The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us
        and the Services, the choices you make, and the products and features you use. The personal

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Usage Data.</strong> Data about how you interact with our Services. This
            includes data such as access dates and times, app features or pages viewed, app crashes

            or imprecise. Precise location data can be Global Position System (GPS) data, as well as
            data identifying nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi hotspots, when you enable
            location-based Services or features. Imprecise location data includes, for example, a
            location derived from your IP address or data that indicates where you are located with
            less precision, such as at a city or postal code level.
        </li>

            <strong>Content.</strong> Content of files and communications you input, upload,
            receive, create, and control.

            data related to a support or service query.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We may also collect information that is normally considered non-identifying or anonymous
        when you use the Services, such as device identifiers, and other
        information collected via cookies, pixel tags, and other technologies. We may combine this
        information with personal information to identify you or to create a profile about you.

    <p>
        All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate,
        and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.

    <!-- Data Sharing Section -->
    <h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>
        We may share your personal information with third parties in the ways that are described in
        this privacy notice. We may share your personal information with:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Service Providers.</strong> Third-party vendors, consultants, and other service
            providers who perform functions on our behalf or provide us with services, such as
            hosting and maintenance, analytics, customer service, data storage and management,
            marketing, email delivery, and database management services. We have contracts with our
            service providers that prohibit them from sharing the information about you that they
            collect or that we provide to them with anyone else, or using it for other purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Advertising Partners.</strong> Third-party advertising companies who help us
            analyze our advertising campaigns and third-party advertising networks that require the
            data to select and serve relevant advertisements to you and others.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Professional Advisors.</strong> Professional advisors, such as lawyers,
            bankers, auditors, and insurers, where necessary in the course of the professional
            services that they render to us.

        <li>
            <strong>Business Transferees.</strong> Relevant participants in business transactions
            (or potential transactions) involving a corporate divestiture, merger, consolidation,
            acquisition, reorganization, sale, or other disposition of all or any portion of the
            business or assets of, or equity interests in, Agezence or our affiliates (including,
            in connection with a bankruptcy or similar proceedings).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Business Partners.</strong> Third parties with whom we partner to provide you
            with products, services, and advertising. We may provide third-party advertisers with
            information about you that allows them to reach the kind of audience they want to
            target. We may also share your information with third parties when you engage in certain
            activities through our Services that are sponsored by them, such as purchasing products
            or services offered by a third party, electing to receive information or
            communications from a third party, or electing to participate in contests, sweepstakes,
            games, or other programs sponsored, in whole or in part, by a third party. When we
            share your personal information with third parties, we have contracts in place that
            prohibit them from sharing that information with anyone else or using it for other
            purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Other Users.</strong> Any personal information that you voluntarily choose to
            include in a publicly accessible area of the Services, such as a public profile page,
            will be available to other users who access that content. Once you make your personal
            information available to others in any of these ways, it may be collected and used by
            the recipients without restriction. We cannot control the use of such information by
            others.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Third-Party Social Networking Services.</strong> If you choose to access or use
            third-party social networking services, we may receive information about you that you
            have made available to those social networking services, including information about
            your contacts on those social networking services.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>As Required By Law and Similar Disclosures.</strong> We may access, preserve,
            and disclose your personal information, other account information
            and content if we believe doing so is required or appropriate to: (i) comply with law
            enforcement or national security requests and legal process, such as a court order or
            subpoena; (ii) respond to your requests; (iii) protect your, our or others' rights,
            property, or safety; (iv) to enforce Agezence policies or contracts; (v) to collect
            amounts owed to Agezence; (vi) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate
            to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation or
            prosecution of suspected or actual illegal activity; or (vii) if we, in good faith,
            believe that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Our Stance On Third-Party Websites -->
    <h2>Our Stance On Third-Party Websites</h2>
    <p>
        The Services may link to third-party websites, online services, or mobile applications
        and/or contain advertisements from third parties that are not affiliated with us and which
        may link to other websites, services, or applications. Accordingly, we do not make any
        guarantee regarding any such third parties, and we will not be liable for any loss or damage
        caused by the use of such third-party websites, services, or applications. The inclusion of
        a link towards a third-party website, service, or application does not imply an endorsement
        by us. We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of data you provide to any third parties.
        Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this privacy notice. We are not
        responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third
        parties, including other websites, services, or applications that may be linked to or from
        the Services. You should review the policies of such third parties and contact them directly
        to respond to your questions.
    </p>

    <!-- Social Logins -->
    <h2>Social Logins</h2>
    <p>
        Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social
        media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this,
        we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The
        profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned,
        but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well
        as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.

        We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this
        privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note
        that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information
        by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice
        to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can
        set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.
    </p>

    <!-- Information Storage -->
    <h2>Information Storage</h2>
    <p>
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes
        set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by
        law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will
        require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which
        users have an account with us.

        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we
        will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example,
        because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely
        store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is
        possible.
    </p>

    <!-- Information Safety -->
    <h2>Information Safety</h2>
    <p>
        We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security
        measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However,
        despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission
        over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so
        we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third
        parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or
        modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information,
        transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You
        should only access the Services within a secure environment.
    </p>

    <!-- Collecting Information From Minors -->
    <h2>Collecting Information From Minors</h2>
    <p>
        We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using
        the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian
        of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that
        personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will
        deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our
        records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18,
        please contact us using the contact information provided.
    </p>

    <!-- User Rights Section -->
    <h2>User Rights</h2>
    <p>
        In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable
        data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of
        your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the
        processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In
        certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your
        personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us using the contact
        information provided.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection
        laws.
    </p>
    <p>
        f you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your

        protection authority or UK data protection authority.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data Protection and
        Information Commissioner.
    </p>
    <p>
        Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal
        information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law,
        you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at
        any time by contacting us using the contact information provided.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its
        withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal
        information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
    </p>
    <p>
        Opting out of marketing and promotional communications: You can unsubscribe from our
        marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in
        the emails that we send, or by contacting us using the contact information provided.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, we may still communicate with you — for example, to send you service-related
        messages that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to
        service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.
    </p>

    <!-- Account Information -->
